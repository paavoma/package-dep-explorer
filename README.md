### About the app
This is a React app that exposes some key information about packages in the file /var/lib/dpkg/status in Debian or Ubuntu via an HTML interface.

Since JavaScript doesn't allow to probe local filesystem, user must provide the file manually.

### Features:
- Packages can be browsed via clicking the name, or available dependencies.
- User can write notes on individual packages, which are saved.
- Session data persists through refresh or reboot, it uses local storage. Clear local storage-button was created for testing convinience.
- Ui is usable on mobile as well but since it requires to input files, it is redundant atm, but it can be used for future iterations on mobile as well.

### Live demo

Link to Heroku deployment: https://package-dep-explorer.herokuapp.com/

### Installing and running project locally
- git clone https://github.com/paavoma/package-dep-explorer.git
- cd package-dep-explorer
- npm install (make sure you have installed npm locally)
- npm start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
